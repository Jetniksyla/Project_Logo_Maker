# **SVG Logo Maker**

## Overview

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application designed to help freelance web developers quickly generate simple logos for their projects. The application prompts users to input text, select text color, choose a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and pick a shape color. It then generates an SVG file based on the user's input, allowing them to create customized logos without the need for a graphic designer.

## Features

- Generate logos with customizable text and shape options.
- Save generated logos as SVG files for easy use in web projects.
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Utilizes Inquirer for user input and Jest for unit testing.
